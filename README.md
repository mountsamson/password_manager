Project: Simple Password Manager

Description:
A password manager is a tool that helps you securely store and manage your passwords for different accounts. In this project, we'll create a simple password manager using Python that stores passwords in a JSON file. The manager allows users to add, view, and search for accounts, as well as generate passwords.

Features:

Add Account: Users can add a new account along with its username and password.
View Accounts: Users can view all saved accounts and their corresponding usernames.
Search Accounts: Users can search for an account by entering its name.
Generate Password: Users can generate a strong, random password for a new account.
Implementation:

Storage: Accounts and passwords are stored in a JSON file (passwords.json).
Add Account: Users input the account name, username, and password. This information is then stored in the JSON file.

Search Accounts: Users can search for an account by entering its name. If found, the username and password are displayed.
Generate Password: Users can generate a random password using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
Usage:


This project provides a basic but effective way to manage passwords and can be further expanded with additional features and security measures.
